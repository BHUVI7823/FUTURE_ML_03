# 🤖 Customer Support Chatbot using Dialogflow (Task 3 – Future Interns Internship)

This repository contains a **Customer Support Chatbot** created as part of **Task 3** during my Machine Learning Internship with **Future Interns**. The chatbot is designed to handle basic customer queries, mimic real e-commerce support systems, and provide instant automated responses.

## 📌 About the Task

In this task, I built a virtual assistant that:
- Answers common customer questions
- Provides support 24/7
- Mimics tools used on websites like **Amazon**, **Flipkart**, and **Zomato**

## ✅ What I Did

- Used **Dialogflow** (a no-code chatbot builder)
- Designed **sample FAQs** like “Where is my order?” and “Can I return a product?”
- Created intents and responses in Dialogflow's interface
- Tested the chatbot live within Dialogflow
- Connected the chatbot to a real website using **Streamlit**
- Integrated basic responses from **ChatGPT API** (for dynamic response testing)
