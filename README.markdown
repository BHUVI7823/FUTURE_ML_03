# Customer Support Chatbot

## Overview
This project is a **Customer Support Chatbot** developed for Task 3 of the Future Interns Internship. The chatbot is designed to handle common customer queries (e.g., "Where is my order?") and provide instant, 24/7 responses, similar to systems used by platforms like Amazon or Zomato. Built using **Dialogflow**, it features conversational flows for greetings, FAQs, and fallback responses, with an optional web deployment via **Streamlit**.

## Features
- **Greeting Intent**: Responds to user greetings like “Hi” or “Hello”.
- **FAQ Handling**: Answers common customer queries (e.g., “Track my order”, “What are your return policies?”).
- **Fallback Response**: Manages unrecognized queries with a default response.
- **Churn Probability Insights**: Trained on real-world customer queries for realistic interactions.
- **Web Deployment**: Optionally hosted on Streamlit for browser-based access.

## Usage
- Explore the chatbot in Dialogflow’s testing interface to interact with intents.
- Analyze responses to identify effective conversational flows.
- Use insights to enhance customer support automation.
- Access the optional Streamlit app for web-based interaction.

## Data Source
The chatbot intents were trained using the **Customer Support Chat Dataset** from Kaggle, providing real-world customer query examples.
